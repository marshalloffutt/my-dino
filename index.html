            <h2>Marshall Offutt</h2>
            <p>I am 35 years old, and I am currently a project manager for a 
                strucutral engineering firm. Things that I love include my wife, 
                my dogs, and scotch whisky. I take great joy in travel, running, 
                reading, and learning new things. My favorite type of food is Indian. 
                I have an aggressive dislike for long walks on the beach. Because 
                why walk on the beach when you can swim? And if you don't want to 
                swim then why go to the beach in the first place?
            </p>

            <h2>Stegosaurus</h2>
            <p>The stegosaurus has always my favorite dinosaur because he had cool plates on
                his back for protection. In addition to these plates, he also had a 
                barbed tail which he used to whack his opponents. It is a pretty sweet 
                evolutionary trait. Famous stegosauruses include Godzilla. Godzilla 
                was basically just an angry stegosaurus due to extreme radiation.
